<p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is a part of Homeland Security that investigates human trafficking networks both domestically and internationally. ICE coordinates with other law enforcement agencies such as Interpol and Europol to bring sex traffickers to justice and rescue the victims. ICE has also launched various campaigns such as the Hidden in Plain Sight campaign whose goal is to draw the American public's attention to the plight of human-trafficking victims in the United States. The campaign message explains that human trafficking includes those who are sexually exploited or forced to work against their will. ICE’s mission is to dismantle the sex trafficking networks and provide support for the victims when they are rescued.

<figcaption>The US Department of Justice has dedicated itself to ending the global menace of sex trafficking. The DOJ has successfully prosecuted human trafficking crimes in brothels, escort services, bars, and strip clubs. Thanks to enhanced police and prosecutorial powers provided by the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, augmented victim-protection provisions due to the act, and increased public awareness programs introduced by the act, as well as sustained dedication to combating human trafficking, the numbers of trafficking investigations and prosecutions have increased dramatically thanks to partnerships with other law enforcement agencies such as ICE and the FBI. The DOJ is continuing to strengthen its partnerships with the ICE, FBI, and other law enforcement agencies to identify and develop more resources in the fight against human sex trafficking through its inter-agency Anti-Trafficking Coordination Team Initiative.

<h3>Sex Trafficking Statistics</h3>  
<section>
<img src="images/justice/trafficking_chart-a.jpg" alt="stats" />
<p>The FBI places the number of sex trafficking victims both domestic and international in the millions. According to FBI statistics on human sex trafficking, the average age of female victims is around 12 to 14 years old. For boys and transgendered youth, it’s around 11 to 13 years old. Sex trafficking is also becoming a growing problem in the US with the CIA estimating that between 45,000-50,000 victims are being trafficked each year in the US alone with the most common victims being teenage runaways. UNICEF estimates that the global market of child sex trafficking is estimated to be worth over $12 billion a year. These statistics show a disturbing trend where countless youth are being exploited by sex traffickers every day for huge profits at expense of the victims.</p>
